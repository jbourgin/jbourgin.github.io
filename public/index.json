In this study, we hypothesized that patients with AD might show a deficit of orientation toward emotional information under conditions of visual search. Eighteen patients with AD, 24 age-matched controls, and 35 young controls were eye-tracked while they performed a visual search task on a computer screen. The target was a vehicle with implicit (negative or neutral) emotional content, presented concurrently with 1, 3, or 5 non-vehicle neutral distractors. The task was to find the target and to report whether a break in the target frame was on the left or on the right side. Both control groups detected negative targets more efficiently than they detected neutral targets, showing facilitated engagement toward negative information. In contrast, patients with AD showed no influence of emotional information on engagement processes. However, all groups reported the frame break location more slowly for negative than for neutral targets (after accounting for the last fixation delay), showing a more difficult disengagement from negative information. These findings are the first to highlight a selective lack of emotional influence on engagement processes in patients with AD.","tags":["Alzheimer's disease","attention","emotion","eye movements","aging"],"title":"Impact of Emotionally Negative Information on Attentional Processes in Normal Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bourgin","J.","Roger","E.","Pichat","C.","Renard","F.","Jaillard","A.","Cousin","E.","Silvert","L.","Baciu","M.","\\\u0026 Hot","P."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584364677,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"6ad6f27388ccdee544c7433f64b5db22","permalink":"/publication/adni2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T14:17:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/adni2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We used resting-state fMRI and diffusion-weighted imaging to investigate changes in attention-related and salience networks in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

However, evidence regarding the impact of this early atrophy on cognitive and emotional processes is still lacking. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the consequences of amygdala alterations on the processing of emotional information in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to guide searches, extraction and reporting of data in this review. We referred to the electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO to search for articles that were published up to 9 July 2019. We included studies that assessed the correlation between structural and/or functional characteristics of the amygdala and performances in a task involving emotional stimuli in patients with AD or MCI. Risk of bias was rated using a 7-item validity scale assessing methodological rigor, selection and reporting bias. 28 studies were included that concerned emotional memory, face expression recognition, or emotional attention. Together, they suggest that amygdala alterations in AD lead to emotional memory deficit and amygdala hyperactivation to emotional stimuli with variability between studies. In the second part of this review, we discuss the fact that previous emotional protocols performed with AD patients are not sufficiently dedicated to the assessment of amygdala activity, masking some emotional decline in these patients. In this frame, we provide evidence suggesting that emotional attention is a promising way of investigation. In addition, we propose that future studies may need to take advantage of recent methods in amygdala segmentation and multimodal neuroimaging.","tags":["amygdala","emotion","Alzheimer's Disease","mild cognitive impairment","MRI"],"title":" Involvement of Amygdala Alterations in Emotional Processing in Alzheimer’s Disease : a Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pascal Hot","Jessica Bourgin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584352758,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"abf6c77e934a0797cc877a316b97c82b","permalink":"/project/emotional/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T10:59:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/emotional/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["diffusion","fmri"],"title":"Emotional attention in pathological aging","type":"project"},{"authors":["Pascal Hot","Jessica Bourgin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584352398,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"72231fb291edd83310804da09574fb4c","permalink":"/project/multimodal/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T10:53:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/multimodal/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Neuroimaging"],"title":"Multimodal neuroimaging analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Boris New","Christophe Pallier","Jessica Bourgin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584351630,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"981c0e776fea92af3fdd548516dae481","permalink":"/project/lexique/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T10:40:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/lexique/","section":"project","summary":"Lexique est une base de données qui fournit, pour 140 000 mots de la langue française, diverses informations.","tags":["language","R Shiny"],"title":"Lexique","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jessica Bourgin","Alexandre Maréchal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584350454,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"aaabfe68084dab31d2761b5a7a6a18ba","permalink":"/project/boogui/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T10:20:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/boogui/","section":"project","summary":"Boogui is a software dedicated to viewing and processing gaze data recorded with EyeLink or SMI eye trackers.","tags":["eyetracking"],"title":"Boogui","type":"project"},{"authors":["Bourgin","J.","Guyader","N.","Chauvin","A.","Juphard","A.","Sauvée","M.","Moreaud","O.","Silvert","L.","\\\u0026 Hot","P."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1526467707,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"81c939387d77a53e44e6e661467a7894","permalink":"/publication/early2018/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T11:48:27+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/early2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Emotional deficits have been repetitively reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) without clearly identifying how emotional processing is impaired in this pathology. This paper describes an investigation of early emotional processing, as measured by the effects of emotional visual stimuli on a saccadic task involving both pro (PS) and anti (AS) saccades. Sixteen patients with AD and 25 age-matched healthy controls were eye-tracked while they had to quickly move their gaze toward a positive, negative, or neutral image presented on a computer screen (in the PS condition) or away from the image (in the AS condition). The age-matched controls made more AS mistakes for negative stimuli than for other stimuli, and triggered PSs toward negative stimuli more quickly than toward other stimuli. In contrast, patients with AD showed no difference with regard to the emotional category in any of the tasks. The present study is the first to highlight a lack of early emotional attention in patients with AD. These results should be taken into account in the care provided to patients with AD, since this early impairment might seriously degrade their overall emotional functioning.","tags":["Alzheimer's disease","attention","emotion","eye movements","inhibition"],"title":"Early Emotional Attention is Impacted in Alzheimer’s Disease : an Eye-Tracking Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520256600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584438086,"objectID":"69e1c3c5cfdd8702f4062116eaf7355c","permalink":"/talk/jev2018/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T15:47:48+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/jev2018/","section":"talk","summary":"La Maladie d’Alzheimer (MA) est une pathologie neurodégénérative caractérisée par une atrophie précoce de l’amygdale.

Les mouvements oculaires de treize patients MA, 31 participants contrôles appariés en âge et 30 participants contrôles jeunes ont été enregistrés pendant qu’ils effectuaient une tâche de recherche visuelle sur un écran d’ordinateur. La cible à rechercher était une image de moyen de transport avec un contenu émotionnel (négatif ou neutre) implicite, présentée en concurrence avec une, trois ou cinq images distractrices neutres ne représentant pas un moyen de transport. Une fois que les participants avaient trouvé la cible, ils devaient identifier une cassure située à gauche ou à droite dans le cadre entourant l’image cible. Les groupes contrôles présentaient des pentes de recherche plus plates lorsque la cible avait un contenu négatif plutôt que neutre, montrant un engagement facilité vers une information émotionnelle négative. De plus, le temps de réponse quant à l’emplacement de la cassure (tenant compte du délai de fixation initial) chez ces deux groupes était plus élevé pour une cible à contenu négatif plutôt que neutre, montrant un désengagement plus difficile de l’information négative. En revanche, les patients MA ne présentaient pas d’influence de l’information émotionnelle sur les mécanismes d’engagement et de désengagement. Ces résultats préliminaires sont les premiers à mettre en évidence un déficit d’influence de l’information émotionnelle sur les processus d’engagement et de désengagement dans la MA.","tags":["Alzheimer's disease","emotion","attention","eye movements","aging"],"title":"Influence d’une information émotionnelle négative sur les processus d’engagement et de désengagement dans la Maladie d’Alzheimer : un paradigme de recherche visuelle en eye-tracking","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499331602,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584438086,"objectID":"9bdff2e23a7048169dbe0d7ef2a63889","permalink":"/talk/clermont2017/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T15:57:02+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/clermont2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Alzheimer's disease"],"title":"Attention émotionnelle \u0026 Maladie d'Alzheimer","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Kauffmann","L.","Bourgin","J.","Guyader","N.","\\\u0026 Peyrin","C."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1450275584,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584371403,"objectID":"f10913e01c57ebb80fc951a1d0c5a58a","permalink":"/publication/freq2015/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T15:19:44+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/freq2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Current models of visual perception suggest that during scene categorization, low spatial frequencies (LSF) are processed rapidly and activate plausible interpretations of visual input. This coarse analysis would then be used to guide subsequent processing of high spatial frequencies (HSF). The present fMRI study examined how processing of LSF may influence that of HSF by investigating the neural bases of the semantic interference effect. We used hybrid scenes as stimuli by combining LSF and HSF from two different scenes, and participants had to categorize the HSF scene. Categorization was impaired when LSF and HSF scenes were semantically dissimilar, suggesting that the LSF scene was processed automatically and interfered with categorization of the HSF scene. fMRI results revealed that this semantic interference effect was associated with increased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior parietal lobules, and the fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. Furthermore, a connectivity analysis (psychophysiological interaction) revealed that the semantic interference effect resulted in increasing connectivity between the right fusiform and the right inferior frontal gyri. Results support influential models suggesting that, during scene categorization, LSF information is processed rapidly in the pFC and activates plausible interpretations of the scene category. These coarse predictions would then initiate top–down influences on recognition-related areas of the inferotemporal cortex, and these could interfere with the categorization of HSF information in case of semantic dissimilarity to LSF.","tags":["visual perception","spatial frequencies","scenes","fmri"],"title":"The neural bases of the semantic interference of spatial frequency-based information in scenes","type":"publication"}]
