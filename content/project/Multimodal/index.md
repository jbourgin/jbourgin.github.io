![analysis](/project/multimodal/analysis.png)
During my [thesis work](/project/emotional), I conducted analyses involving neuroimaging data (diffusion MRI, fMRI and MRI).

To perform these analyses, I used scripts for data extraction from a large database, [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/), and used several tools such as [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/), [Conn](https://web.conn-toolbox.org/), [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), [MRtrix](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [volBrain](https://www.volbrain.upv.es/), [TractoFlow](https://tractoflow-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [MRIQC](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Based on what I learned, I am working on tutorials and user-friendly scripts that will soon be available on Github.
