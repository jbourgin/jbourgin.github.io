Body in Brain is a project led at University Savoie Mont Blanc by [Morgane Metral](https://www.lippc2s.fr/person/1893-2/) and [Jean-David Boucher](https://fr.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/jeandavidboucher).

This project aims at developing a standardized tool for body schema assessment. This tool will notably include a web platform with several modules based on tactile sensitivity, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. See [Project Body in Brain](https://www.fondation-usmb.fr/projet/body-in-brain/) for more information.

I am currently building the web part of the project. This website will be available at [BodyinBrain](https://psycho-usmb.fr/bodyinbrain).
