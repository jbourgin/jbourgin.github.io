Lexique is a web tool created by [Boris New](https://psycho-usmb.fr/boris.new/) and [Christophe Pallier](http://www.pallier.org/), and available at [Lexique](http://www.lexique.org/). It currently includes two main components.

## Lexique

<i>Lexique</i> is a database that provides, for 140,000 french words, various informations.
For instance, it can provide frequency of occurrence in various corpus, phonological representation, associated lemmas, number of syllables, grammatical category, and more.

## Openlexicon

<i>Openlexicon</i> regroups several lexical databases, including Lexique, providing additional information such as age of acquisition, reading time or concreteness.
