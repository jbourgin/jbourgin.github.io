I am currently working as a design engineer in statistics and scientific computing at the <a href = 'https://www.univ-smb.fr'>University Savoie Mont Blanc</a> in Chambéry (France).

Having a PhD in Cognitive Science, my research focuses on studying emotional attention in normal aging and in Alzheimer's Disease, using eye-tracking and neuroimaging tools.

Please use the following link to find information about my thesis work: <a href = 'https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02485293/'>Thesis</a>.
